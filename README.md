### What I'm Working On ATM :hatching_chick::hatching_chick::hatching_chick:  
+ [MicroMouse](https://github.com/srukelman/micromouse) : I saw a few videos of micromouse and found the concept intriguing, so I decided to try my own. This was also an opportunity for me to practice my data structures and algorithms to make the fastest maze-solving algorithm.

### My Favorite Projects :hatched_chick::hatched_chick::hatched_chick:
+ [Robot Code for Team 6220 FIRST Robotics Competition](https://github.com/Team-6220/2023) : code for the robot that won **2nd place** at our regional competition in 2023
+ [Stock Option Webscraper](https://github.com/srukelman/stockOptionWebScraping) : I taught myself webscraping in **python** in order to quickly gather data from Yahoo Finance on PUT options for DOW stocks, then analyzed and sorted data to help select best PUT options to buy. Later I added a GUI to make it more user friendly and a program to open charts to look more in depth at each stock selection.
+ [Handicap Tracker](https://github.com/srukelman/HandicapTracker) : This was my first programming experience in which I learned PHP and SQL. I learned how to use HTTP requests, manage databases, and also basic Web App security including password authentication and encryption, all while making a useful tool for golfers to measure their handicap.
